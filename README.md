# 🎲 Dice Game

A simple web-based dice rolling game that randomly generates two dice rolls and declares the winner or a draw.

## 📌 Live Demo  
You can view the live demo of this project here: [https://swadu11.github.io/dices_game/]()

## 🚀 Features  
- Generates a random dice roll for **Player 1** and **Player 2**  
- Dynamically updates dice images based on random numbers  
- Displays the **winner** or **draw** based on the dice roll results  
- Fully responsive and styled using **CSS**  

## 📂 Project Structure  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML** - Structure of the web page  
- **CSS** - Styling the page layout  
- **JavaScript** - Random dice roll logic and DOM manipulation  

## 📜 How It Works  
1. When the page loads, two random numbers (1-6) are generated.  
2. The numbers correspond to dice images (e.g., `dice1.png` to `dice6.png`).  
3. The images update dynamically for both players.  
4. The **winner** is displayed based on which player has the higher number.  
5. If both dice are the same, it results in a **draw**.
